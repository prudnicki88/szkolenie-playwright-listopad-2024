npm init playwright@latest

Getting started with writing end-to-end tests with Playwright:
Initializing project in '.'
âˆš Do you want to use TypeScript or JavaScript? Â· `TypeScript`
âˆš Where to put your end-to-end tests? Â· `tests`
âˆš Add a GitHub Actions workflow? (`y`/N) Â· `true`
âˆš Install Playwright browsers (can be done manually via 'npx playwright install')? (`Y`/n) Â· `true`
Initializing NPM project (npm init -y)â€¦
Wrote to C:\Projects\testuj-sii-playwright-listopad\package.json:
...

âœ” Success! Created a Playwright Test project at C:\Projects\testuj-sii-playwright-listopad

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npx playwright test
    Runs the end-to-end tests.

  npx playwright test --ui
    Starts the interactive UI mode.

  npx playwright test --project=chromium
    Runs the tests only on Desktop Chrome.

  npx playwright test example
    Runs the tests in a specific file.

  npx playwright test --debug
    Runs the tests in debug mode.

  npx playwright codegen
    Auto generate tests with Codegen.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

    npx playwright test

And check out the following files:
  - .\tests\example.spec.ts - Example end-to-end test
  - .\tests-examples\demo-todo-app.spec.ts - Demo Todo App end-to-end tests
  - .\playwright.config.ts - Playwright Test configuration
